This example demonstrates how you can create image converting pipeline and run it via 
`capycmd` command line app.

To try it out:
```bash
# Copy the images you want to convert to "images" directory
$ cp $HOME/Pictures/capybara.png images

# Run capycmd to convert the images (need Docker)
$ ./converter.capycmd.sh
```
